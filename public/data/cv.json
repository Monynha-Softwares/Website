    "bio": "Software engineer focused on digital products, automation, and DevOps. Passionate about accessibility, open-source, and inclusive design. Founder of Monynha Softwares — a creative laboratory that unites technology, diversity, and digital art. Monynha Softwares was born from a collective dream: to prove that technology and affection can coexist, that innovation also comes from the margins, and that the web can be a space of welcoming, creation, and resistance. Our mission is clear: 'to democratize technology, combat hypocrisy, and give voice to those who create outside the norm.' In other words, we seek to transform what was once a privilege into an opportunity for everyone, ensuring that access to technological tools is not a luxury, but a right shared by all communities. Our vision for the future is an inclusive digital culture, where creativity and technological knowledge flourish in the peripheries as much as in the center, breaking down socioeconomic barriers and expanding opportunities for participation.",

Aesthetics are only complete when they are understandable. Beauty is only beautiful when it is accessible.\n\nAt Monynha Softwares, every interface is born from a simple principle: **empatia como arquitetura**. Creating is not just drawing pixels; it's understanding contexts, recognizing differences, and ensuring that no one is left out of the digital experience.\n\nWe implement adequate contrasts, clear visual hierarchies, and keyboard navigation from the first prototype. We avoid animations that may cause discomfort to motion-sensitive individuals, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. Every component is designed to be useful, not just beautiful.\n\nMore than just complying with WCAG standards, we treat accessibility as an expression of respect. Every *alt-text* is an invitation to inclusion; every *aria-label* is a coded gesture of empathy.\n\nInclusive design is not a competitive differentiator — it is a political and ethical act. Because if technology is made by people, for people, then it must embrace all forms of existence. 💜"

That the web can be a space of welcome, creation, and resistance.\n\nThe name carries this essence. *\"Mona\"*, word of resistance from Pajubá, and the suffix *\"-nynha\"*, loving and peripheral expression, symbolize the mix of tenderness, humor, and courage that define who we are. We create with love, but also with purpose — every project is a way of saying: **we are here and we are not going back into the technology closet.** 🏳️‍🌈\n\nOur manifesto is simple: **democratize the digital, celebrate difference, and hack the system with pride.** Through free software, accessible design, and diverse communities, we seek to transform what was once privilege into possibility.\n\nFrom open-source apps and platforms to cultural and educational initiatives, every line of code written by Monynha is a gesture of creative resistance. Our products — like BotecoPro, FACODI, and AssisTina — are not just technological solutions; they are living manifestations of empathy, inclusion, and representation.\n\nBeing Monynha means understanding that technology is language, and language is power. That every person who sees themselves in a product is more than a user — they are a protagonist. And that's why we continue to create, day after day, with the certainty that **diversity is also performance.** 💅✨"
